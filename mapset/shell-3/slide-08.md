# County Lines and Famous Names

Before 1614, the lands of New York were under Indian stewardship. In 1624, Holland formally set up a colony, naming it "New Netherlands." In 1664, England ousted the Dutch, renaming their new colony "New York." In 1683, it was divided into 12 counties. And, to the west of Albany County stood a vast region whose stewards were the Haudenosaunee peoples.   

Today, the State of New York State consists of 62 Counties. Most are shown below. Some were carved out of former counties. Then, as white settlement increased and population grew, new counties were split off, formed and given new names. Move your cursor over any shape to display the county's name.
